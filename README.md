# brickbracker

I have developed a brick breaker game with java. I have used JFrame and JPanel for drawing different graphics to make this game work. In this game, the player moves a PADDLE from side-to-side to hit a BALL. The gameâ€™s objective is to eliminate all of the BRICKS at the top of the screen by hitting them with the BALL. But, if the ball hits the bottom, the player loses and the game ends! if player manages to hit all the bricks, the player wins!
